way to observe what is going on near the BH at the place where the jet is initially launched. Where the ballistic jet blobs are ﬁnally observed they are clearly magnetized — it is what enables the charged particles to produce radiation via the synchrotron mechanism — but this is at distances ∼ 1010GM/c2. 4. Summary In summary, the case for a generalized version of the Penrose process being the power source behind astrophysical jets has become signiﬁcantly stronger in the last few years. Computer simulations have been very helpful in this regard since they enable one to study semi-realistic conﬁgurations of magnetized accretion ﬂows and to explore quantitatively how mass, energy and angular momentum ﬂow through the system. Recent computer experiments ﬁnd unambiguous indications for energy extraction from spinning BHs via magnetic ﬁelds. Whether these simulated models describe real BHs in nature is not yet certain. However, completely independent observational data suggest a link between the spins of transient stellar-mass BHs and the energy output in ballistic jets ejected from these systems. The observationally measured quantity “Jet Power” in Figure 4 increases steeply with the measured BH spin, and the dependence is quite similar to that found both in simple analytical models [29, 5] and in simulations (Fig. 2). Taking all the evidence into account, the authors believe that Penrose’s seminal ideas on energy extraction from spinning BHs are relevant for the production of at least some categories of relativistic astrophysical jets.

its low speed, the magnetically-driven jet in the counter-rotating disk case is nevertheless noteworthy because it extracts rota- tional energy from the black hole. While the process is similar to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford & Znajek 1977), it appears more closely related to the model of Takahashi et al. (1990). In our case, the electromag- netic ﬁeld energy is transformed immediately into kinetic energy in the jet. A more detailed analysis and further calculations will be reported in our next paper. Recently, Wardle et al. (1998) detected circularly polar- ized radio emission from the jets of the archetypal quasar 3C279. They concluded that electron-positron pairs are important components of the jet plasma. Similar detec- tions in three other radio sources have been made (Homan et al. 1999), which suggests that, in general, extragalactic radio jets may be composed mainly of an electron-positron pair plasma. The electron-positron plasma is probably produced very near the black hole. The mechanism we have investigated here, magnetically-driven jet powered by extraction of rotational energy of a black hole, is a strong candidate for explaining the acceleration of such electron- positron jets.

Time evolution of jet formation in the counter-rotating disk case and the ﬁnal state of the co-rotating disk case. Color shows the logarithm of the proper mass density; vectors indicate velocity; solid lines show the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. The black fan-shaped region at the origin shows the horizon of the Kerr black hole (a = 0.95). The dashed line near the horizon is the inner boundary of the calculation region. At t = 0 and t = 30τS the state of the co-rotating and counter-rotating disk cases are almost identical. However, at t = 47τS, while the infall of the disk in the co-rotating disk stops (due to a centrifugal barrier), the unstable orbits of the counter-rotating disk plasma continue to spiral rapidly toward the black hole horizon. This diﬀerence causes the magnetohydrodynamic jet formation mechanisms in the two cases to diﬀer drastically, resulting in a powerful jet emanating from deep within the ergosphere. Fig. 2. Plasma beta (color) and azimuthal component of the magnetic ﬁeld Bφ (contour) in the counter-rotating and co-rotating disk cases. Solid lines show negative value of Bφ and the dashed lines positive values. The two cases diﬀer signiﬁcantly in structure, with the jet in the counter-rotating case originating much closer to the black hole. Fig.

Schwarzschild metric show only sub-relativistic jet ﬂow (Koide, Shibata, & Kudoh 1999a), except for the case when the initial black hole corona is in hydrostatic equilibrium rather than free fall (Koide, Shibata, & Ku- 1 2 doh 1998). Several mechanisms for relativistic jet formation from rotating black holes have been proposed (Blandford & Zna- jek 1977, Takahashi et al. 1990). However, up until now no one has performed a self-consistent numerical simula- tion of the dynamic process of jet formation in a rotat- ing black hole magnetosphere. To this end, we have de- veloped a Kerr general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (KGRMHD) code. In this paper we report brieﬂy on what we believe are some of the ﬁrst calculations of their kind — simulation of jet formation in a rotating black hole mag- netosphere. 2. NUMERICAL METHOD We use a 3 + 1 formalism of the general relativistic con- servation laws of particle number, momentum, and energy and Maxwell equations with inﬁnite electric conductivity (Thorne, Price, & Macdonald 1986). The Kerr metric, which describes the spacetime around a rotating black hole, is used in the calculation. When we use Boyer- Lindquist coordinates, x 0 = ct, x 1 = r, x 2 = θ, and x 3 = φ, the Kerr metric gµν is written as follows, ds2 = gµν dx µdx ν = −h2 0(cdt) 2+ 3∑ i=1 h2 i (dx i) 2−2h3Ω3cdtdx 3. (1) By modifying the lapse function in our Schwarzschild black hole code (α = √ 3 the disk falls rapidly into the ergosphere. Inside the static limit , the velocity of frame dragging exceeds the speed of light (cΩ3/α > c), causing the disk to rotate in the same direction of the black hole rotation (relative to the ﬁxed Boyer-Lindquist frame), even though it was initially counter-rotating. The rapid, diﬀerential frame dragging greatly enhances the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld, which then accelerates the ﬂow upward and pinches it into a powerful collimated jet. Figure 1d shows a snapshot of the co-rotating disk case at t = 47τS. The disk stops its infall near R = 3rS due to the centrifugal barrier with a shock at r = 3.4rS. The high pressure behind the shock causes a gas pressure-driven jet with total and poloidal velocities of v = vp = 0.30c at R = 3.4rS, z = 2.4rS. A detailed analysis shows that a weak magnetically-driven jet is formed outside the gas pressure- driven jet with maximum total and poloidal velocities of v = 0.42c and vp = 0.13c, respectively. This two-layered shell structure is similar to that of Schwarzschild black hole case (Koide, Shibata, & Kudoh 1998). The centrifu- gal barrier makes the disk take much long time to reach the ergosphere, which causes the diﬀerence between the co-rotating and counter-rotating disk cases. To more fully illustrate the physics of the jet forma- tion mechanism, in ﬁgure 2 we show the plasma beta, β ≡ p/(B2/2) (color) and the toroidal component of the magnetic ﬁeld, Bφ (contour) in the counter-rotating and co-rotating disk cases at t = 47τS. The blue color shows the region where magnetic ﬁeld dominates the gas pres- sure; light red—yellow shows where gas pressure is domi- nant; and solid contour line shows negative azimuthal mag- netic ﬁeld (Bφ < 0), while the broken line the positive value (Bφ > 0). The toroidal component of the magnetic ﬁeld Bφ is negative and its absolute value is very large above the black hole in both cases. The ﬁeld increases to more than 10 times the initial magnetic ﬁeld. This ampli- ﬁcation is caused by the shear of the plasma ﬂow in the Boyer-Lindquist frame due to the frame dragging eﬀect of the rotating black hole (Yokosawa, Ishizuka, & Yabuki 1991, Yokosawa 1993, Meier 1999). Under the simplifying assumption that the plasma is at rest in the ZAMO frame, the general relativistic Faraday law of induction and ideal MHD condition yield, ∂Bφ 4 rotating disk into a rapidly-rotating black hole (Koide, Meier, Shibata, & Kudoh 1999b). The disk falls toward the black hole more rapidly than the counter-rotating case. At later times (after almost two inner disk turns) it devel- oped a relativistic jet with a velocity of v ∼ 0.9c (Lorentz factor ∼ 2). We believe that, if we had been able to per- form longer-term simulations here, in at least the counter- rotating disk case the magnetically-driven jet also would have been accelerated to relativistic velocities (and possi- bly the co-rotating case as well). Despite its low speed, the magnetically-driven jet in the counter-rotating disk case is nevertheless noteworthy because it extracts rota- tional energy from the black hole. While the process is similar to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism (Blandford & Znajek 1977), it appears more closely related to the model of Takahashi et al. (1990). In our case, the electromag- netic ﬁeld energy is transformed immediately into kinetic energy in the jet. A more detailed analysis and further calculations will be reported in our next paper. Recently, Wardle et al. (1998) detected circularly polar- ized radio emission from the jets of the archetypal quasar 3C279. They concluded that electron-positron pairs are important components of the jet plasma. Similar detec- tions in three other radio sources have been made (Homan et al. 1999), which suggests that, in general, extragalactic radio jets may be composed mainly of an electron-positron pair plasma. The electron-positron plasma is probably produced very near the black hole. The mechanism we have investigated here, magnetically-driven jet powered by extraction of rotational energy of a black hole, is a strong candidate for explaining the acceleration of such electron- positron jets.

Formation of a magnetically-arrested disk and ejection of powerful jets in a GRMHD simulation of magnetized accretion on to a rapidly spinning BH with a∗ = 0.99 [36]. The top and bottom rows in panels (a)-(d) show a time sequence of equatorial and meridional slices through the accretion ﬂow. Solid lines show magnetic ﬁeld lines in the image plane, and color shows log ρ (red high, blue low). The simulation starts with an equilibrium torus embedded with a weak magnetic ﬁeld (panel a). The weakly magnetized orbiting gas is unstable to the MRI, which causes gas and ﬁeld to accrete. As large-scale magnetic ﬂux accumulates at the center, a coherent bundle of ﬁeld lines forms at the center, which threads the BH and has the conﬁguration of bipolar funnels along the (vertical) BH rotation axis. These funnels contain strong ﬁeld and low mass density (lower panels b, c, d). Helical twisting of the ﬁeld lines as a result of dragging of frames causes a powerful outﬂow of energy through the funnels in the form of twin jets. The outﬂow eﬃciency η (panel e), calculated as in equation (5), becomes greater than unity once the ﬂow achieves quasi-steady state at time t ≳ 5000rg/c. This is the key result of the simulation. Having a time-average η > 1 means that there is a net energy ﬂow out of the BH, i.e., spin energy is extracted from the BH by the magnetized accretion ﬂow. This constitutes a demonstration of the generalized Penrose process in the astrophysically relevant context of a magnetized accretion ﬂow. 4 outﬂow. To understand the energetics, consider the rate of ﬂow of energy, ˙E(r) = ∫ ∫ θ,ϕ T r t dAθ,ϕ, (3) where the stress-energy tensor of the magnetized ﬂuid is T µ ν = ( ρ + ug + pg + b2 1.00.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 a 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 Figure 2. Time-average outﬂow eﬃciency η versus BH spin parameter a∗ for a sequence of GRMHD simulations of non-radiative BH accretion ﬂows [34]. The eﬃciency exceeds unity for a∗ ≳ 0.9. Negative values of a∗ correspond to the accretion ﬂow counter-rotating with respect to the BH. Returning to the simulation under consideration, Figure 1(e) shows the outﬂow eﬃciency η as a function of time. It is seen that the average eﬃciency exceeds unity once the ﬂow achieves steady state at time t ≳ 5000rg/c, where rg = GM/c2. The outﬂow thus carries away more energy than the entire rest mass energy brought in by the accretion ﬂow. This is an unambiguous demonstration of the generalized Penrose process in the astrophysically plausible setting of a magnetized accretion ﬂow on to a spinning BH. Of course, it is not obvious that the energy necessarily ﬂows out in a collimated relativistic jet, since the quantity η is deﬁned via global integrals (eqs. 2, 5) which do not specify exactly where the outﬂowing energy ends up. A more detailed analysis reveals that the bulk of the energy does indeed go into a relativistic jet, while about 10% goes into a quasi-relativistic wind [34]. Figure 1 corresponds to an extreme example, viz., a very rapidly spinning BH with a∗ = 0.99. Figure 2 shows results from a parameter study that investigated the eﬀect of varying a∗. It is seen that the time- average η increases steeply with increasing a∗. For an accretion ﬂow that corotates with the BH, the power going into the jet can be well-ﬁt with a power-law dependence, ηjet ≈ 0.65a2(1 + 0.85a2). (6) This approximation remains accurate to within 15% for 0.3 ≤ a∗ ≤ 1. For low spins, the net eﬃciency derived from the simulations is greater than that predicted by equation (6). For example, as Figure 2 shows, the simulation gives a non-zero value of η for a∗ = 0, which is inconsistent 6 with equation (6). This is because, for a∗ = 0, all the outﬂow energy comes directly from the accretion ﬂow, most of which goes into a wind. Nothing comes from the BH, whereas equation (6) refers speciﬁcally to the eﬃciency ηjet associated with jet power from the BH. With increasing BH spin, both the disk and the hole contribute to energy outﬂow, with the latter becoming more and more dominant. For spin values a∗ > 0.9, the BH’s contribution is so large that the net eﬃciency exceeds unity. Before leaving this topic, we note that other numerical simulations have used geometrically thicker accretion conﬁgurations than the one shown in Figure 1 and ﬁnd even larger values of η [33, 20]. 3. Empirical Evidence for the Generalized Penrose Process As discussed in §2, there is deﬁnite evidence from computer simulations that the generalized Penrose process is feasible, and even quite plausible, with magnetized accretion ﬂows. We discuss here recent progress on the observational front. In §3.1 we brieﬂy summarize eﬀorts to measure spin parameters of astrophysical BHs. Then in §3.2 we discuss a correlation that has been found between jet power and BH spin. Finally in §3.3 we explain why we think the observational evidence favors a Penrose-like process rather than disk power. 3.1. Spin Parameters of Stellar-Mass Black Holes In 1989, the ﬁrst practical approach to measuring black hole spin was suggested [7], viz., modeling the relativistically-broadened Fe K emission line emitted from the inner regions of an accretion disk. The ﬁrst compelling observation of such a line was reported six years later [32]. Presently, the spins of more than a dozen black holes have been estimated by modeling the Fe K line (see [28] for a recent review). In 1997, a second approach to measuring black hole spin, the “continuum-ﬁtting method,” was proposed [38]. In this method, one ﬁts the thermal continuum spectrum of a black hole’s accretion disk to the relativistic model of Novikov & Thorne [25]. One then identiﬁes the inner

power varies by a factor ≳ 1000 among the ﬁve objects shown. method 2. Later, [31] included a ﬁfth BH, H1743-322, whose spin had been just measured. Figure 4a shows the inferred ballistic jet luminosities of these ﬁve objects plotted versus black hole spin. The quantity “Jet Power” along the vertical axis refers to the scaled maximum radio luminosity (νSν )D2/M , where ν (= 5 GHz) is the radio frequency at which the measurements are made, Sν is the radio ﬂux density in janskys at this frequency at the peak of the ballistic jet radio light curve, D is the distance in kiloparsecs, and M is the black hole mass in solar units. There is unmistakeable evidence for a correlation between the observationally determined quantity Jet Power and a∗. Although there are only ﬁve data points, note that Jet Power varies by nearly three orders of magnitude as the spin parameter varies from ≈ 0.1 − 1. The very unequal horizontal errorbars in Figure 4a are a feature of the continuum-ﬁtting method of measuring a∗. Recall that the method in eﬀect measures RISCO and then deduces the value of a∗ using the mapping 2 In the case of a ﬁfth transient BH, 4U1543-47, radio observations did not include the peak of the light curve, so one could only deduce a lower limit to the jet power, which is shown as an open circle in Figure 4a. 10 shown in Figure 3. Since the mapping is non-linear, especially as a∗ → 1, comparable errors in RISCO correspond to very diﬀerent uncertainties in a∗. In addition, the use of log a∗ along the horizontal axis tends to stretch errorbars excessively for low spin values. Figure 4b, based on [31], illustrates these eﬀects. Here the horizontal axis tracks log RISCO rather than log a∗, and the horizontal errorbars are therefore more nearly equal. The key point is, regardless of how one plots the data, the correlation between Jet Power and black hole spin appears to be strong. 3.3. Why Generalized Penrose Process? Assuming the correlation shown in Figure 4 is real, there are two immediate implications: (i) Ballistic jets in stellar-mass BHs are highly sensitive to the spins of their underlying BHs. (ii) Spin estimates of stellar-mass BHs obtained via the continuum-ﬁtting method are suﬃciently reliable to reveal this long-sought connection between relativistic jets and BH spin. With respect to (i), the mere existence of a correlation does not necessarily imply that the generalized Penrose process is at work. We know that the accretion disk itself is capable of producing a jet-like outﬂow [4, 9, 13]. Furthermore, the gravitational potential well into which an accretion disk falls becomes deeper with increasing BH spin, since the inner radius of the disk RISCO becomes smaller (Fig. 3). Therefore, a disk-driven jet is likely to become more powerful with increasing spin. Could this be the reason for the correlation between Jet Power and spin seen in Figure 4? We consider it unlikely. The radiative eﬃciency ηdisk of a Novikov-Thorne thin accretion disk increases only modestly with spin; for the spins of the ﬁve objects shown in Figure 4, ηdisk = 0.061, 0.069, 0.072, 0.10 and 0.19, respectively, varying by only a factor of three. Of course, there is no reason why the power of a disk-driven jet should necessarily scale like ηdisk. Nevertheless, the fact that ηdisk shows only a factor of three variation makes it implausible that a disk-powered jet could have its radio luminosity vary by three orders of magnitude. In contrast, any mechanism that taps directly into the BH spin energy via some kind of generalized Penrose process can easily account for the observed variation in Jet Power. Analytical models of magnetized accretion predict that the jet eﬃciency factor should vary as ηjet ∝ a2 [29, 5] or ηjet ∝ Ω2 H [35], where ΩH is the angular frequency of the BH horizon 3. The dashed line in Figure 4a corresponds to the former scaling, and the solid lines in Figure 4b to the latter scaling; equation (6), which is obtained by ﬁtting simulation results, is intermediate between the two. The observational data agree remarkably well with the predicted scalings, strongly suggesting that the generalized Penrose process is in operation. 3 The two scalings agree for small values of a∗, but diﬀer as a∗ → 1. 11 We cannot tell whether the energy extraction in the observed systems is mediated speciﬁcally by magnetic ﬁelds (as in the simulations), since there is no way to observe what is going on near the BH at the place where the jet is initially launched. Where the ballistic jet blobs are ﬁnally observed they are clearly magnetized — it is what enables the charged particles to produce radiation via the synchrotron mechanism — but this is at distances ∼ 1010GM/c2. 4. Summary In summary, the case for a generalized version of the Penrose process being the power source behind astrophysical jets has become signiﬁcantly stronger in the last few years. Computer simulations have been very helpful in this regard since they enable one to study semi-realistic conﬁgurations of magnetized accretion ﬂows and to explore quantitatively how mass, energy and angular momentum ﬂow through the system. Recent computer experiments ﬁnd unambiguous indications for energy extraction from spinning BHs via magnetic ﬁelds. Whether these simulated models describe real BHs in nature is not yet certain. However, completely independent observational data suggest a link between the spins of transient stellar-mass BHs and the energy output in ballistic jets ejected from these systems. The observationally measured quantity “Jet Power” in Figure 4 increases steeply with the measured BH spin, and the dependence is quite similar to that found both in simple analytical models [29, 5] and in simulations (Fig. 2). Taking all the evidence into account, the authors believe that Penrose’s seminal ideas on energy extraction from spinning BHs are relevant for the production of at least some categories of relativistic astrophysical jets.

positron pairs within the jet, even close to the horizon scale. The possibility of giving constraint on this mecha- nism based on our model is discussed in text S4. Our results bridge the dynamical model of jet formation and ob- servations, demonstrating the viability of the BZ- jet model and magnetic reconnection as the mechanism for electron acceleration in jets. The models will be sharpened in the future by incorporating more detailed particle acceleration by reconnection, obtaining more elaborate electron energy distribution in the jet, and by comparison with observations of higher resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three- dimensional GRMHD numerical simulation of a hot accretion flow We have performed numerical simulations in three- dimension by solving the equations of ideal MHD describing the evolution of the accretion flow around a black hole in the Kerr metrics using the GRMHD code Athena++ (29, 30). The code uses a finite- volume Godunov scheme to ensure total energy conservation, with the flux of conserved quantities obtained by solving the Riemann problem at each interface. The commonly used HLLE Riemann solvers are used in our simulations (31). The staggered- mesh constrained transport method is applied to satisfy the divergence- free constraint to pre- vent spurious production of magnetic monopoles. We use the piece- wise linear method for spatial reconstruction. It will be interesting to examine the effects of adopting the piecewise parabolic method in the future (32). CBA DE F Fig. 2.

The radius of the black hole horizon is rH = (1 + √1 − a2)rg , with rg = GMBH c2 the gravitational radius and a the spin parameter of the black hole. The determinant of the met- ric g ≡ det (gμν) = −Σ2sin 2θ , where Σ = r2 + a2cos 2θ (33). We use ρ to denote the comoving rest- mass density, and u μ as the component of the coordinate- frame four velocity. The equation of state of the gas is u = pgas/(Γ − 1), where the pgas is the gas pressure of the comoving mass, u is the internal energy of the gas, and Γ is the adiabatic index. We set Γ = 4/3 in our simulation and use unit rg/c to measure the time. The unit we adopt is Heaviside- Lorentz, in which both the light speed and gravity constant are set to be unity, and the sign conven- tion of the metric is (−, +, +, +). The metric is stationary, and the self- gravity of the accretion flow is ignored in our simulations. There are two accretion modes, SANE and MAD, depending on the magnetization of the accretion flow (5, 34, 35). We have simu- lated four models, namely, MAD98, MAD05, MAD00, and SANE98. They denote the MAD accretion flow around a black hole of spin a = 0.98, 0.5, and 0.0, and SANE accretion flow around a black hole of spin a = 0.98. In all models, the simulation starts with a rotating torus around a black hole. The torus is in a hydrostatic equilibrium state as described by Fishbone and Moncrief (36). The inner edge of the torus is at r = 40.5rg, and the radius of pressure maximum is at r = 80rg. We have also added a poloidal magnetic field threading the torus in the way described by Penna et al. (37). For MAD and SANE, we use two different initial magnetic field configurations. For MAD, we set one poloidal loop threading the whole torus. This leads to rapid accretion and accumulation of a large amount of magnetic flux near the black hole, which eventually impedes the accretion of mass. For a given mass accretion rate, the magnetic flux quickly saturates at a maximum value on the black hole, reaching the MAD state. For SANE, we initially set up a seed field consisting of multiple poloidal loops of magnetic field with changing polarity. This struc- ture facilitates magnetic reconnection and prevents the accumula- tion of magnetic flux, such that the magnetic field always remains weak, making the accretion flow stay in the SANE mode (34, 35). To determine the specific magnetic field of the torus, three pa- rameters are required, namely, rstart, rend and λB. The first two repre- sent the inner and outer edges of the magnetized area, while the last one controls the size of the poloidal loops or equivalently the num- ber of the loops. We use the gas- to- magnetic pressure ratio β ≡ pgas/pmag to normalize the magnetic field. For each loop, it has a minimum value in the equatorial plane. It peaks at the edge of the loop and then drops to the center of the loop. For MAD, we set rstart = 25 rg, rend = 810 rg, λB = 25 (it just has one loop), and βmin = 0.1. For Fig. 3.

Ho10,11, Xi Lin1,2, Andrzej A. Zdziarski 12, Jieshuang Wang 13 The formation of jets in black hole accretion systems is a long- standing problem. It has been proposed that a jet can be formed by extracting the rotation energy of the black hole (“BZ- jet”) or the accretion flow (“disk- jet”). While both models can produce collimated relativistic outflows, neither has successfully explained the observed jet morphology. By using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and considering nonthermal elec- trons accelerated by magnetic reconnection that is likely driven by magnetic eruption in the underlying accretion flow, we obtain images by radiative transfer calculations and compared them to millimeter observations of the jet in M87. We find that the BZ- jet originating from a magnetically arrested disk around a high- spin black hole can well reproduce the jet morphology, including its width and limb- brightening feature. INTRODUCTION How a jet forms from a black hole accretion flow has been an impor- tant unsolved problem. The current consensus is that jet formation requires a combination of magnetic fields and rotation. The most in- fluential model (BZ- jet) is that of Blandford- Znajek (1), in which the jet is formed by extracting the spin energy of the black hole via the magnetic field lines connected to its event horizon. The analytical predictions of this scenario have been confirmed by general relativis- tic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that successfully produce relativistic collimated outflows (2–5). However, it has been unclear whether the BZ- jet can explain the observed morphology of the jet, including its elongated structure, width, and limb- brightening. As an alternative to black hole spin, the jet can also be powered by extracting the rotation energy of the accretion flow by the mag- netic centrifugal force or the gradient of the magnetic pressure (6, 7). Such a disk- jet model has also received support from numerical simulations (8–10). Which of these two leading competing scenari- os matches the jets observed in active galactic nuclei? RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This work uses three- dimensional GRMHD simulations to repro- duce the detailed structure of the jet in M87 to test its formation mechanism. We simulate a hot accretion flow around a black hole using the ATHENA++ code (11). The details of how we perform the simulations and the numerical convergence test are presented in the “Three- dimensional GRMHD numerical simulation of a hot accre- tion flow” and “Convergence of numerical resolution” sections in Materials and Methods, respectively. Because the black hole in M87 is likely rapidly rotating and the accretion flow is likely to be a mag- netically arrested disk (MAD) instead of undergoing standard and normal evolution (SANE) (12, 13), our fiducial model is a MAD around black holes with spin a = 0.98 (MAD98). For comparison, we also simulate a SANE around a black hole with a = 0.98 (SANE98) and two MADs around black holes with a = 0.5 (MAD05) and a = 0 (MAD00). The two- dimensional distributions of several physical quantities of MAD98 are shown in fig. S2. Specifically, the red line in each panel of fig. S2 denotes the boundary of the BZ- jet. To calculate the radiation of the jet, we need to quantify the elec- tron distribution, including both the thermal and nonthermal com- ponents. Because our MHD simulation is for a single fluid, we calculate the temperature of thermal electrons following the ap- proach presented in (14), which is a function of the plasma β (the ratio between gas and magnetic pressure) and two other free param- eters Rlow and Rhigh (the “Determination of distributions of thermal and nonthermal electrons” section in Materials and Methods). A large fraction of radiation of the jet is believed to originate from nonthermal electrons, but the specific mechanism of electron ac- celeration has been a mystery. Here, we assume that the mechanism is magnetic reconnection. Numerical simulations have found that MADs are subject to magnetic flux eruptions that occur when a magnetic flux bundle containing strong vertical fields escapes from the black hole’s magnetosphere and propagates radially outward into the disk (4, 15–19). These events must strongly perturb the vertical magnetic field lines and can in principle trigger magnetic reconnec- tion in the jet. We have conducted several quantitative analyses and confirmed this scenario (in the “Physical origin of magnetic recon- nection in the jet” section in Materials and Methods). In light of the particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection (20–24), we assume that the accelerated electrons follow a power- law energy distribution. Details on how we determine the minimum Lorentz factor (γmin) and power- law index (p) of the electron energy distribution are given in the “Determination of distributions of ther- mal and nonthermal electrons” section in Materials and Methods. For our problem, one of the most important parameters is the 1Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, chinese Academy of Sciences; 80 nandan Road, Shanghai 200030, china. 2University of chinese Academy of Sciences; 19A Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, china. 3tsung- dao lee institute, Shanghai Jiao tong University, Shengrong Road 520, Shanghai 201210, china. 4center for Astronomy and Astrophysics and department of Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, china. 5los Alamos national laboratory, los Alamos, nM 87545, USA. 6School of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao tong University, 800 dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200240, china. 7institut für theoretische Physik, Goethe- Universität Frankfurt, Max- von- laue- Str. 1, d- 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 8Key labora- tory of Radio Astronomy and technology, chinese Academy of Sciences, A20 datun Road, chaoyang district, Beijing 100101, PR china. 9Max- Planck- institut für Radio- astronomie, Auf dem hügel 69, d- 53121 Bonn, Germany. 10Kavli institute for As- tronomy and Astrophysics, Peking

jet (“Calculation of radiative transfer in the jet” section in Materials and Methods). We tested 50 snapshots from the simulation data of MAD98 and found that our results are systematically and substantially better than previous works, in the sense that the jet is longer, its width is more consistent with observations, and its limb brightening is much more evident. Figure 2 compares the representative model images at 86 and 43 GHz, demonstrating that only the “current density” model successfully reproduces the opening angle of the jet and the elongated structure up to distance ∼2 mas from the core, while a model only considering thermal electrons fails. The calculated image terminates at ∼2 mas because it reaches the outer boundary of our simulation domain. For comparison, the best result obtained in previous work is only ~1 mas (26), similar to our “thermal- only” model. Moreover, the long- standing puzzle of the observed limb- brightening feature of the jet is clearly reproduced, as shown by Fig. 3 (“Calculation of ra- diative transfer in the jet” section in Materials and Methods). By contrast, models that only consider thermal electrons or homoge- neous distributions of nonthermal electrons produce very weak limb- brightening features (26, 28). In addition, we have examined a test model in which Npl/Ntot is fixed to be 0.5, while all other model parameters remain the same with our fiducial model. The jet images predicted by this model have been calculated and are shown in fig. S6. Comparing the (flux contour) results with those presented in Fig. 2, we can see that this model is more similar to the thermal- only model rather than the current- density model because the limb- brightening Fig. 1.

The total flux densities predicted by our model at 86 and 43 GHz are 1.24 and 2.0 jansky (Jy), in comparison with the observed ranges of 0.95 to 1.59 Jy and 0.99 to 1.33 Jy at these two frequencies, of which 58 and 64% originates from nonthermal electrons. Because the plasma density in our model is normalized to reproduce the flux density at 230 GHz, our model correctly reproduces the flux densities at 230 and 86 GHz but moderately overpredicts that at 43 GHz. This is likely because our model is still too simplified in some aspects. To quantify the jet morphology, Fig. 4 illustrates the variation of the jet width as a function of projected distance from the core as predicted by different models (“Calculation of the jet width” section in Materials and Methods) and compares them with observations. The jet width predicted by the MAD98 model agrees reasonably well with observations throughout the entire projected jet extent from 0.1 to 2 mas. This improvement compared to previous works, along with the better match of the length and limb- brightening of the jet, is attributed to our more physical model for the nonthermal elec- tron population. That the jet width is smaller than the boundary between a BZ- jet and disk- jet (cyan line in Fig. 4) indicates that the observed jet corresponds to the former instead of the latter. Our fiducial model also satisfies the constraints based on the ve- locity field, jet power, and polarization (text S2). In text S3, we inves- tigate the effects of black hole spin and the accretion mode on the predicted jet image. We find that a MAD and a rapid spin are fa- vored to explain the observations. In some jet models, the emission is dominated by electron- positron pairs within the jet, even close to the horizon scale. The possibility of giving constraint on this mecha- nism based on our model is discussed in text S4. Our results bridge the dynamical model of jet formation and ob- servations, demonstrating the viability of the BZ- jet model and magnetic reconnection as the mechanism for electron acceleration in jets. The models will be sharpened in the future by incorporating more detailed particle acceleration by reconnection, obtaining more elaborate electron energy distribution in the jet, and by comparison with observations of higher resolution.

From the relation between the Lorentz factor 𝛤𝛤 and velocity 𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣, 𝛤𝛤 ≡ (1 − 𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣2)−1/2, we can calculate the predicted velocity 𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣 of the jet plasma. The velocity obtained from observation is the apparent speed of the moving components in the jet, 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝. The intrinsic speed 𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣 is calculated using the equation 𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣 = 𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝/(𝛽𝛽𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝜃𝜃𝑣𝑣 + 𝑐𝑐𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝜃𝜃𝑣𝑣). The comparison of the value 𝛤𝛤𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣 between simulation and the observation is shown in Fig. S11. We can see that the predicted velocity is consistent with observations. The second constraint is the jet power. Due to the physical uncertainties in the models used to estimate the jet power and the wide range in length and timescales probed by the observations, a wide range of powers is obtained, from 10 42𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔 𝑐𝑐−1 to 10 45𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔 𝑐𝑐−1 (62).

The power of BZ-jet calculated in MAD98, MAD05, and SANE98 are 6.3 × 10 43𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔 𝑐𝑐−1 , 3.1 × 10 43𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔 𝑐𝑐−1 , 9.6× 10 42𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔 𝑐𝑐−1, respectively. All are within the observed range. The third constraint is polarization. High angular resolution polarimetric observations of the nucleus of M87 are performed using the Very Long Baseline Array at 24 GHz and 43 GHz, and polarization structures within ~0.7 (at 43 GHz) -1 (at 24 GHz) mas around the core region are obtained (73). The average linear polarization degree is about 2-3%. We have calculated the polarization degree predicted by our fiducial MAD98 model using the IPOLE code. In the calculation, we first get the Stokes I, Q, U and V at 43GHz, then convolve each component with the beam of 0.38 × 0.17 𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐 at −10∘. The calculation result for the central nuclear region of M87 is shown in Fig. S14. Comparing this result with that shown in Ref. (73), we can see that the predicted polarization degree is notably higher than the observed value. The reason is because our calculation only takes into account the depolarization due to the plasma within our simulation domain, i.e., 𝑒𝑒 ≲ 1000𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔 from the black hole. The RM due to the plasma in this region is small because of the small inclination angle and the low gas density close to the jet axis. From the detailed theoretical modeling presented in Ref. (13), the RM contributed by the plasma outside the simulation domain, mainly the wind launched from the hot accretion flow in M87, can be as large as ≥ 10 5 𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑟𝑟/𝑚𝑚2; thus strong depolarization is expected there. This prediction is consistent with the result obtained by the VLBA observations (74), which show that the RM is of external origin and larger than 10 4 𝑒𝑒𝑎𝑎𝑟𝑟/𝑚𝑚2 at a de-projected distance of as large as 10 4𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔. The detailed calculation of the depolarization by this part of plasma is beyond the scope of the present paper. The high polarization degree we obtain therefore implies that our theoretical prediction is not in conflict with observations. S3 Images of jet predicted by other accretion modes and black hole spin To show the effects of accretion mode and black hole spin, we have calculated the images corresponding to other three models, i.e., MAD05, MAD00, and SANE98. We have searched 30 (for MAD05), 20 (for SANE98), and 20 (for MAD00) snapshots from their simulation data after the models have reached their steady states and calculated their images. The representative results are shown in Fig. S15. For MAD05 and SANE98, the predicted jet extends along the jet axis up to 2 mas, similar to MAD98. However, both models fail to reproduce the limb-brightening feature. Moreover, the predicted jet width by the SANE98 model is too small compared to observations, as shown by Fig. 4. To understand the reasons, we show in Fig. S16 the two-dimensional spatial distributions of 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝/𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐. For all three models, we find that, at distances not too far away from the black hole, say 𝑧𝑧 < 400𝑒𝑒𝑔𝑔, the large value of 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝/𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 (thus high number density of accelerated nonthermal electrons) are distributed in a rather broad layer, not as narrow as in the case of MAD98. This may be the reason for the absence of limb-brightening in their predicted images. For SANE98, different from MAD98 and MAD05, the value of 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝/𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 is also very high at the region very close to the jet axis. This explains why the jet width predicted by SANE98 is too small, as shown in Fig. 4. For MAD00, we find from the figure that the value of 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝/𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 close to the black hole is notably smaller than the other three models. This implies there are fewer nonthermal electrons in the jet and may explain why almost no elongated jet-like structure is seen in the middle panel of Fig. S15. The results of the spatial distribution of 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝/𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 in all four models, including their differences among them, should be caused by their specific configurations of the magnetic field lines, which in turn must be due to the differences of accretion mode and black hole spin. S4 Is it possible to put constraints on the pair cascade model? In addition to the electron-proton model presented in the present paper, there are alternative electron-positron models in the literature for the emission of the jet in M87 (75-79). In these models, pairs are produced by photon-photon collision processes and are accelerated by unscreened electric fields in the magnetosphere of the rotating black hole. The accelerated particles Compton up-scatter background photons, which collide with other background photons and produce a pair cascade. The radiation of these pairs could be responsible

RESEARCH:
**TL;DR:** Black holes with strong magnetic fields can launch relativistic jets by extracting energy from the black hole's rotation through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. The spinning black hole acts like a dynamo, twisting magnetic field lines that thread through it, creating powerful electromagnetic forces that accelerate matter to near light-speed in narrow, collimated beams.

**Key Points:**

• **Energy Source**: The rotational energy of spinning black holes powers these jets through a process called the generalized Penrose process
• **Magnetic Field Role**: Strong magnetic fields threading the black hole get twisted by frame-dragging effects, creating the focusing mechanism
• **Jet Power Correlation**: Observational evidence shows jet power increases dramatically with black hole spin rate
• **Two Formation Modes**: Jets can form from magnetically arrested disks (MAD) or standard accretion flows (SANE), with MAD producing more powerful jets

**How Energy Extraction Works:**

The fundamental mechanism behind relativistic jets involves extracting rotational energy from spinning black holes through magnetic field interactions. When a black hole rotates, it drags spacetime around it in a phenomenon called **frame-dragging**. This effect becomes extreme near the **ergosphere** — the region outside the event horizon where spacetime rotation exceeds light speed.

**Magnetic Field Amplification**: As magnetized plasma from an accretion disk falls toward the black hole, the differential rotation and frame-dragging effects dramatically amplify the magnetic field strength. Computer simulations show magnetic fields can increase by more than 10 times their initial values. The **azimuthal magnetic field component** (Bφ) becomes particularly strong due to this shearing motion.

**The Blandford-Znajek Process**: This mechanism works like a cosmic dynamo. Magnetic field lines threading through the black hole's event horizon get twisted by the hole's rotation. This creates a **Poynting flux** — electromagnetic energy flow — that extracts rotational energy from the black hole and channels it outward along the magnetic field lines. The process is most efficient for rapidly spinning black holes with dimensionless spin parameters approaching 1.

**Jet Collimation and Acceleration:**

The narrow, beam-like structure of jets results from magnetic focusing. Strong **poloidal magnetic fields** (running from pole to pole) create magnetic pressure that pinches the outflowing material into tight columns. Meanwhile, the twisted magnetic field lines act like springs under tension, accelerating particles to relativistic speeds — often reaching 90% the speed of light or more.

**Magnetically Arrested Disks (MAD)**: The most powerful jets form when magnetic flux accumulates around the black hole until it becomes so strong that it actually impedes further accretion of matter. This creates a **magnetically arrested disk** state where the magnetic field dominates the dynamics. MAD configurations can achieve **energy extraction efficiencies exceeding 100%** — meaning the jet carries away more energy than the entire rest mass of the infalling material.

**Observational Evidence:**

Recent studies of stellar-mass black holes show a strong correlation between black hole spin and jet power. The **jet power varies by nearly three orders of magnitude** as spin increases from 0.1 to 1, matching theoretical predictions. This correlation strongly supports the Blandford-Znajek mechanism over alternative disk-powered jet models, which would show much weaker spin dependence.

**Particle Acceleration**: Within the jets, **magnetic reconnection** events — where magnetic field lines break and reconnect — accelerate electrons to high energies. These accelerated particles produce the observed radio emissions through **synchrot
